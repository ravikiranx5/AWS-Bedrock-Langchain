Yes, in the scenario where you have your API Gateway outside of your VPC and you want to access resources within your VPC (such as your Fargate containers), you can use either a VPC Endpoint or a VPC Link, depending on your specific use case and requirements.

Here's a brief explanation of each:

VPC Endpoint:

A VPC Endpoint allows you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services without requiring internet gateway, NAT devices, VPN connections, or AWS Direct Connect.
If you want to access resources within your VPC (e.g., Fargate containers) from the API Gateway without traversing the public internet, you can use a VPC Endpoint.
You would create a VPC Endpoint for the API Gateway service, which establishes a private connection between your VPC and the API Gateway.
VPC Link:

A VPC Link is used specifically with API Gateway to expose HTTP/HTTPS resources within your VPC to the internet through API Gateway.
If you want to expose your Fargate containers (hosted within your VPC) via API Gateway to the public internet, you would set up a VPC Link.
This allows your API Gateway to securely communicate with resources in your VPC while still being accessible from the internet.
In your scenario, if you want to access resources within your VPC (Fargate containers) from the Amazon API Gateway, you would typically use a VPC Endpoint. This provides a secure and private connection between your API Gateway and your VPC without exposing your resources to the public internet.

If you want to expose your Fargate containers via API Gateway to the internet, you would set up a VPC Link. This allows your API Gateway to securely communicate with resources within your VPC while still being accessible from the internet.

Both VPC Endpoint and VPC Link serve different purposes and can be used based on your specific architecture and security requirements.
